## General

* Comparing

At the very very least, compare laptops based on their specs, Notebookcheck data, and performance



* **Memory**

If you're using anything remotely capable(i.e. most laptops above $500), dual channel memory is extremely recommended.

Furthermore, pay attention to the CAS Latency(for e.g. CL17) of the RAM. Many DIMMs are advertised as CL1x, but actually end up having a timing of something like 1x-1x-4x(!). The lower the latency the better.

* **CPUs**

Ryzen Mobile itself is decent, but the drivers are universally poor, and they unfortunately tend to have less performance per watt than Intel alternatives, i.e. less battery life.

Intel ULV CPUs, denoted by a 'U' at the end of the SKU, e.g. i5 7200U, are NOT meant for extended performance in any way.

Intel 8th generation ULV CPUs are almost always power limited, and cannot perform to their potential. and there are only a few units that actually power them fully. Units that are powered decently are often unable to cool these CPUs. These are NOT meant to be '15W' CPUs; they are more or less nerfed i7 7700HQs.

Furthermore, very few units are able to make use of an 8th generation ULV i7, the i7 8550U, and usually there is no reason to choose a i7 8550U over a i5 8250U, aside from potentially higher resale value(due to the 'i7' branding).

A note on the i9 8950HK: There are very few units that will be able to cool this CPU *and* be able to overclock it. There is also a significant price gap for a comparatively small performance jump(without overclock); you are often paying for the 'i9' name.

* **GPUs**

Max Q GPUs from Nvidia, particularly the high end SKUs, are usually extremely power limited to be able to perform without...melting. There is a [large performance disparity](https://www.notebookcheck.net/We-benchmark-the-mobile-RTX-2060-2070-and-2080-Max-Q-and-compare-them-to-the-desktop-RTX-2080-and-GTX-1080.402036.0.html) between desktop/laptop GPUs and Max Q variants of the same card, and moreover, sometimes the Max Q cards themselves have a [significant performance disparity](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-created-equal-Razer-Blade-15-RTX-2070-Max-Q-is-10-to-15-percent-faster-than-the-Gigabyte-Aero-15-X9.406211.0.html), either due to thermals or varying boost clocks. If you are considering a laptop with a Max Q GPU, ensure that it performs far above average.


## Not Recommended

* **Razer Laptops**

The 14" Razer Blade laptops suffer from extremely poor thermals and hence thermal throttling. The newer 15" Blades, while they are cooled somewhat decently, and do not thermal throttle, they suffer from awful quality control(i.e. being delivered broken), to the point where Amazon has had to stop selling them.

* **HP Gaming Laptops**

Basically none of the HP gaming laptops, such as the Omen line but also the cheaper Pavillion laptops cool well. Moreover, the Omen line is far overpriced for the components.

* **Microsoft Surface Line**

They are built decently, but have literally **zero** repairability. Their warranty is literally to replace the unit. Furthermore, they are overpriced, particularly the Surface Book line.

* **Low End MSI units and the GS line**

The GS line is heavily featured and praised online, but cannot cool its components, and as result, throttles. Low end MSI units such as the GV line should also be avoided, unless at a insanely low price, while understanding that you will get poor quality.

The MSI lines go, in increasing price & quality: GV => GL => GF=> GP => GE => GS (thin) => GT (big)







## Websites

* AnandTech @ [anandtech.com](anandtech.com) - Probably by far the most ‘true’ site that still remains

* Notebookcheck @ [notebookcheck.net](notebookcheck.net) - Use for news and data on laptops and phones. Their rating system and overall reviews themselves aren’t anything good; just use it for data on laptops and phones, such as performance, battery, screen specs(probably the only place that tests laptop panels), etc.
