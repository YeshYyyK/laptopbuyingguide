## Websites

* AnandTech @ [anandtech.com](anandtech.com) - Probably by far the most ‘true’ site that still remains

* Notebookcheck @ [notebookcheck.net](notebookcheck.net) - Use for news, data on laptops and phones. Their rating system and overall reviews themselves aren’t anything amazing; just use it for data on laptops and phones, such as performance, battery, screen specs(probably the only place that tests laptop panels), etc.
