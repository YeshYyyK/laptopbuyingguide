## Not Recommended

* **Razer Laptops**

The 14" Razer Blade laptops suffer from extremely poor thermals and hence thermal throttling. The newer 15" Blades, while they are cooled somewhat decently, and do not thermal throttle, they suffer from awful quality control(i.e. being delivered broken), to the point where Amazon has had to stop selling them.

* **HP Gaming Laptops**

Basically none of the HP gaming laptops, such as the Omen line but also the cheaper Pavillion laptops cool well. Moreover, the Omen line is far overpriced for the components.

* **Microsoft Surface Line**

They are built decently, but have literally **zero** repairability. Their warranty is literally to replace the unit. Furthermore, they are often overpriced, particularly the Surface Book line.

## Websites

* AnandTech @ [anandtech.com](anandtech.com) - Probably by far the most ‘true’ site that still remains

* Notebookcheck @ [notebookcheck.net](notebookcheck.net) - Use for news and data on laptops and phones. Their rating system and overall reviews themselves aren’t anything good; just use it for data on laptops and phones, such as performance, battery, screen specs(probably the only place that tests laptop panels), etc.
